Our group studied two advanced statistical techniques. The first one is Principal Component Analysis on the Enghlish Premier League and the second one is Classification Tree on World Bank data. We use two different datasets to illustrate these techniques. Two flavors of the report are compiled. One is in PDF format and the other one is in Rmarkdown HTML format. We strongly advise our readers to read the HTML report as it is R-friendly with a good balance between discussion text and R codes.
Our group workload allocation is listed below:
Name and SID	Principal component analysis	Classification tree
CHING, Pui Chi 1155102106	33.3%	33.3%
MA, Cheuk Fung 1155106595	33.3%	33.3%
YEUNG, Ka Ming 1155104060	33.3%	33.3%
